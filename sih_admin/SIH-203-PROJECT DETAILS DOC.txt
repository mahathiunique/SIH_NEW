Project Document: Multimodal Offline RAG System
1. Problem Definition
Background
Organizations like NTRO, forensic labs, research institutions, and even individuals deal with massive volumes of unstructured data across various formats:
* Text documents (PDF, DOCX)
* Images (photos, sketches, blueprints, scanned notes)
* Audio recordings (meetings, intercepted calls, lectures)
Current search systems are primitive and limited to:
* Text-only search (filenames, raw text).
* Sorting/filtering by date, size, file type.
* Manual browsing (which is time-consuming and error-prone).
This makes finding relevant content frustrating, slow, and often inaccurate.
Practical Scenarios
* Analyst Case (NTRO): An analyst wants to find a "Project Alpha document and its related intercepted audio." Current tools cannot connect text, image, and audio data.
* Researcher Case: A researcher has over 10,000 experiment images and needs to find one specific diagram, but the filename and date are unknown. This could lead to hours of wasted time.
* Forensics Case: An investigator has over 1,000 audio files and remembers a key phrase: “suspect mentioned a money transfer.” Current tools cannot search inside audio semantically.
* Architecture Case: A VAO team stores sketches and blueprints by ID only. If the ID is lost, finding a specific sketch becomes nearly impossible.
* Normal User Case: Someone wants to find a family photo or a voice note but has forgotten the filename or date. The standard OS search fails.
👉 In all these cases, accuracy, speed, and context are lost due to inadequate search tools.
2. Existing Solutions & Gaps
Existing Solutions
* File Explorer / OS Search: Limited to filename and metadata only.
* Google Drive / Cloud Search: Requires an internet connection, making it unsuitable for secure organizations.
* PrivateGPT / AnythingLLM: Offer offline RAG but are text-only and lack multimodal support.
* Palantir Gotham / IBM i2: Powerful but are proprietary, expensive, and cloud-only solutions.
Gaps
* ❌ Lack of true multimodal support (text, image, audio).
* ❌ No cross-modal linking (e.g., linking a sketch to related documents).
* ❌ No offline-first design suitable for sensitive organizations.
* ❌ Weak citation and traceability of information.
* ❌ No intuitive ingestion process (requires manual setup, no drag & drop).
3. Proposed Solution
We propose a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System that works 100% offline.
Key Features
Ingestion Pipeline
* Extract text from PDF/DOCX files.
* Generate image embeddings to capture semantic meaning, not just OCR (using models like CLIP, DINOv2).
* Perform speech-to-text for audio files (using Whisper).
* Store embeddings along with metadata (file path, type, chunk ID).
* Drag & Drop Support: Users can drag PDFs, images, or audio files directly into the application for instant indexing.
Indexing with Incremental Updates
* Perform a one-time full indexing of the initial data.
* Automatically detect new or modified files for updates.
* Smart duplicate handling: If similar content exists in multiple files, the system links them (e.g., “This content also exists in report_v2.pdf”).
* Users can re-embed only changed files or reset the database if needed.
Search & Query Interface
* Natural language search: “Find the audio where I spoke about project X.”
* Multimodal query: Upload a sketch, photo, or audio clip to find related documents, images, or audio.
* Optimized search modes:
   * Exact match: Using Perceptual Hashing to find duplicates or near-duplicates.
   * Semantic match: Using embeddings for conceptual similarity.
* Explainability Layer: Each result shows why it was matched (e.g., semantic similarity, perceptual hash, keyword).
LLM Answer Generation with Citations
* An offline LLM summarizes the retrieved results.
* Every answer is linked to the source file, including page number or timestamp.
* Ensures transparent, citation-based trustworthiness.
Deployment Options
* Desktop application for personal use.
* On-premise server for organization-level deployment with authentication.
Uniqueness (USP)
* ✅ Offline-first multimodal RAG (text, image, audio).
* ✅ Drag & drop ingestion for a simple, demo-friendly experience.
* ✅ Incremental indexing for efficiency.
* ✅ Storage control: Purge or rebuild the database at any time.
* ✅ Explainability layer: Shows why results were matched.
* ✅ Cross-modal retrieval: Connects sketches, documents, and audio.
* ✅ Smart duplicate awareness.
4. Technical Architecture
Workflow
1. Data Ingestion:
   * User selects folder(s) or drags & drops files.
   * System extracts text, generates embeddings, and collects metadata.
   * Incremental detection updates the database automatically.
2. Indexing & Storage:
   * A vector database stores embeddings and metadata.
   * Metadata includes file path, chunk ID, timestamps, and duplicate hashes.
3. Query Handling:
   * A user query (text, audio, or image) is converted into an embedding.
   * The system retrieves the top-k relevant chunks and any duplicate links.
4. LLM Answer Generation:
   * A local LLM summarizes the retrieved chunks.
   * The output includes citations and explainability details.
5. Results Display:
   * The user sees retrieved snippets with clickable citations.
   * If a duplicate is found, "Also present in…" links are displayed.

________________


1. Introduction
Project Synapse aims to transform how analysts, researchers, and investigators interact with massive, multimodal datasets—text documents, images, and audio—through offline, privacy-first, AI-powered search and summarization.
Unlike cloud-based systems, Synapse runs fully offline, supporting sensitive use cases for government agencies, forensics, research labs, and enterprises dealing with confidential data.
This feasibility study examines:
* Technical feasibility: implementation complexity, hardware requirements, performance limits.

* Operational feasibility: ease of deployment, adaptation by end users, maintainability.

* Security & privacy feasibility: compliance with data protection regulations, air-gapped deployment support.

* User acceptance feasibility: usability, training requirements, and change management considerations.

2. Technical Feasibility
2.1 Implementation Approaches
Three implementation approaches were evaluated:
   1. Desktop AppArchitecture (Recommended): Backend services handle indexing, embeddings, search; a lightweight UI interacts via local APIs.

   2. Hybrid Cloud-Offline: Optional cloud compute for heavy inference tasks while keeping embeddings local.

After comparative evaluation (performance, modularity, scalability), the Desktop AppArchitecture emerged as the best fit because:
      * It allows incremental indexing with file monitoring (via Watchdog).

      * Modular backend supports updates and scaling without breaking UI.

      * Low-latency ANN search (ChromaDB/FAISS) ensures responsiveness even on large datasets.

      * Local-only deployment satisfies security and privacy requirements.
